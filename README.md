# Panda 3D Stuff
This repository is for my python scrips for rooms that i will maybe use for animations.

Appropriate credits are given in the .py scripts themselves.

# Requirements (in order to run the scripts)
- [Panda3D 1.10.0](https://www.panda3d.org/download.php?platform=lenny&version=devel&sdk)
- [toontown.py](https://github.com/QED1224/Toontown-Resources/tree/master/panda3d)
- Toontown Phase Files in the Panda3D /models/ directory and the root directory (the same directory where you place the .py files in). 

You can get the phase files from either:
-[Toontown Rewritten](https://toontownrewritten.com)
or
-[Toontown Offline](https://ttoffline.com)

Both will work the same.
